In this project I deconstruct and rebuild Google's homepage—with <s>a little</s> significant help along the way from Chrome DevTools—using HTML and vanilla CSS.

I especially enjoyed integrating <code>flexbox</code> and media queries, as well as applying pseudo-classes <code>:hover</code> and <code>:focus-within</code> for pointer events on containers and their children, in order to rebuild the search form.
